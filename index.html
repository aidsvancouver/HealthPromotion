          <p class="lead">The Health Promotion Case Management (HPCM) program uses acomprehensive approach to health which positions HIV prevention within a broad and inclusive health framework.</p>

          <p>The program promotes health that goes beyond HIV, STIs, and sexual behavior to incorporate physical, social, cultural and mental aspects.

          <ul>
            <li>Gay and bisexual men</li>
            <li>Other men who have sex with men</li>
            <li>Vulnerable women</li>
            <li>Youth</li>
            <li>Aboriginals</li>
            <li>Immigrants and Refugees</li>

          </ul>

          <h2 id="care">Episode of Care</h2>

          <p>Our responsibility is to stabilize emergent situations that can present barriers to your health and well being. We will identify the most appropriate supports within our program and the community.</p>

          <p>Over a period of 1 to 5 months you will work together with a case manager to identify your needs and set achievable goals. Although our aim is for 1 to 5 months of care, you dictate the level and duration of support you need.</p>

          <h3>What's Next?</h3>

          <p>Once you’ve identified that you’ve reached a level of stability, case managers will work with you to plan for your transition by connecting you to appropriate community resources and supports.</p>

          <p>Our case managers will follow up with you 3-6 months post transition.</p>
